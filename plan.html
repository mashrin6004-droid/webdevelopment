  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mashrin Mahbub</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The primary goal is to increase patient bookings for 100SMILES Dental Care by improving the clinic's online presence and making it simple for prospective patients to find service information and contact details. Measurable objective: increase monthly appointment enquiries (phone or email) by 20% within three months of launch, compared to the three months prior.</p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Success will be measured using the following quantitative and qualitative metrics:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appointment enquiries:</strong> Track number of calls and emails that reference the website (target +20% after 3 months).</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion events:</strong> Add a simple contact form or a 'Book an appointment' click counter (or monitor clicks on the phone/email link) and measure increases.</li>
      <li><strong>User engagement:</strong> Monitor page views, time on page, and bounce rate to ensure content is being read (qualitative target: average session duration >1:30).</li>
      <li><strong>Client feedback:</strong> Ask the clinic whether callers find the site useful and whether they report easier access to information.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p><strong>Primary audience:</strong> Local residents of Razole and nearby suburbs aged 25–65 who are looking for family-oriented dental care (routine check-ups, preventative care, and restorative treatment). This group usually values clear practical information, opening hours, and easy contact options.</p>
  <p><strong>How the design caters to them:</strong> The site will be clear and scannable (headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists), include contact details and trading hours prominently, have calls-to-action for booking, and present trust-building information such as staff profiles and basic service explanations.</p>

  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <p>The site will consist of the following pages (order is the navigation order):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Home — key messages, announcements, links to services and contact</li>
    <li>Services — detailed list of services and the Annual Check-Up package</li>
    <li>Our Team — staff profiles and credentials</li>
    <li>Contact — phone, email, address, hours and booking instructions</li>
  </ul>
